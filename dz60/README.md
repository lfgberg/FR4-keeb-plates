# DZ60 FR4 Plate

Plate made to fit the [DZ60 PCB](https://kbdfans.com/products/dz60-60-pcb)

## Usage

* This plate does fit the dz60, however, in it's current state the stab cutouts are too small and need to be revised
* This plate has copper outlined switch cutouts, and my logo silkscreened on it, but is crappy looking and needs to be redone
